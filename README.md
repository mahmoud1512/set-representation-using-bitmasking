# set-representation-using-bitmasking

This is a technique of represnting sets of objects based on the knowledge of universal 
The technique is as follows represent an element with 1 if it is present and zero otherwise

part1:
basic operations of bitmasking (update bit , clear bit , get bit , set bit)

part2:
